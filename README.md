SDEV 140 Final-Project - Mychal Wood
Sorry if this is bad! This is my first time using GitHub to upload something, forgive me please.

Basically what this is is a Project I made in my SDEV 140 Class (Intro to Software Development) at IvyTech Fall of 2021. What it is is a menu that lets you select a color for a cup, and it sets the color to the cup that you clicked the button for.

This originally was supposed to be this big huge project, which would lay out a blueprint for me to transfer this to my mom's website, where the user would be able to design one of these cups with the color they wanted, and the engraved text/logo for my mom's website (www.indylaserdesigns.com), but I talked with Mr. Carver (my professor) and he said that what I had was just fine for the project, so here we are.

This was made with Tkinter Designer (https://github.com/ParthJadhav/Tkinter-Designer), and then heavily modified by me to make the UI more automated, so I could easily manipulate it to the way I wanted to.

The biggest issue I have is that I don't have any classes set up in Tkinter (which this was made with, and this was before I learned about classes and objects in my class), and I would like to update that in the future if I continue working on this.
